# Project Chimera — IDE Agent Rules

Project Context
---------------
This is Project Chimera: an autonomous influencer system. Agents should treat `specs/` as the authoritative source-of-truth.

Prime Directive
---------------
1. NEVER generate or modify implementation code without first referencing the relevant spec section in `specs/`.
2. For any proposed code change, explain a short plan and list the exact spec file and section that authorises the change.

Traceability
------------
- Every action should include `spec_version`, `run_id`, and a short justification string.

Behaviour Rules
--------------
- Always produce a short plan before writing files.
- Prefer creating or updating spec files rather than coding when requirements are ambiguous.
- Run tests (`make test`) before proposing merges; if tests are not runnable, explain why.

Collaboration
-------------
- Commit messages should reference the spec path (e.g., "Implementer: follow specs/technical.md#TrendFetcher").
